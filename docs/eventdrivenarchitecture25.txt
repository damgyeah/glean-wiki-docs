Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software architecture paradigm concerning the production and detection of events. Event-driven architectures are evolutionary in nature and provide a high degree of fault tolerance, performance, and scalability. However, they are complex and inherently challenging to test. EDAs are good for complex and dynamic workloads.
