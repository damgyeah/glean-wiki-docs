Kubernetes (), also known as K8s is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management. Originally designed by Google, the project is now maintained by a worldwide community of contributors, and the trademark is held by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
The name "Kubernetes" originates from the Greek: κυβερνήτης, romanized: kubernḗtēs (governor, helmsman, pilot). "Kubernetes" is often abbreviated as "K8s", counting the eight letters between the "K" and the "s" (a numeronym).
