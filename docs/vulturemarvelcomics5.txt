The Vulture is the alias of several supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, most of whom are depicted as recurring enemies of the superhero Spider-Man and part of his adversaries composing his rogues gallery, typically using special suits which allow them to fly at vast speeds.
The first incarnation of the character, Isidoro Scarlotti, is an Italian scientist and an enemy of the original Human Torch and Toro. The second and most prominent incarnation of the character, Adrian Toomes, is an inventive but maniacal genius who designed his suit and turned to a life of crime, becoming an enemy of Spider-Man and a founding member of the Sinister Six, with later characters to assume the mantle including Blackie Drago, a former cellmate of Toomes, and Clifton Shallot and Jimmy Natale, human/bird hybrids of independent origins. Toomes is later revealed to be the grandfather of the superhero Starling.
