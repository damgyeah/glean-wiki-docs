The New York Bill of Rights is a constitutional bill of rights first enacted in 1787 as a statute, and then as part of the state's constitution in 1881 in the U.S. state of New York. Today, the New York Bill of Rights can be found in Article I of the New York State Constitution and offers broader protections than the federal Bill of Rights.
