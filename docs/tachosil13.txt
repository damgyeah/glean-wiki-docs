Tachosil is an equine collagen sponge coated with the human plasma-derived coagulation factors fibrinogen and thrombin. It is used during surgery to stop local bleeding on internal organs (hemostasis). Tachosil reacts upon contact with blood, other body fluids or saline to form a clot that glues it to the tissue surface.
Tachosil may cause an allergic reaction, thrombosis (blood clots), a blockage in the intestine when used during abdominal surgeries, the formation of scar tissue and foreign body granuloma (a type of inflammatory reaction).
