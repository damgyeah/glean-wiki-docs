The Port of Buenos Aires (Spanish: Puerto de Buenos Aires) is the principal maritime port in Argentina. Operated by the Administraci√≥n General de Puertos (General Ports Administration), a state enterprise, it is the leading transshipment point for the foreign trade of Argentina.
The current port is located in the city's Retiro ward, and is colloquially known as Puerto Nuevo (New Port). The Port of Buenos Aires handles around 11 million metric tons of cargo annually; Dock Sud, which is owned by the Province of Buenos Aires, is south of the city proper, and handles another 17 million metric tons.
