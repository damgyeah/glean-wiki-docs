The 1956 Honduran coup d'état occurred when the Honduran military removed acting President Julio Lozano Díaz on October 21, 1956.
The coup was led by a military junta, consisting of General Roque J. Rodríguez, Colonel Héctor Caraccioli, and Major Roberto Gálvez Barnes, and resulted in the junta governing Honduras until elections were held in 1957. The coup came in response to growing political instability, the suppression of public opposition, and concerns over Lozano Díaz's efforts to consolidate power after suspending the legislature and unilaterally declaring himself president in 1954. This event marked a turning point in Honduran political history, ushering in a period of military involvement in governance and setting a precedent for future interventions by the armed forces in national politics.
