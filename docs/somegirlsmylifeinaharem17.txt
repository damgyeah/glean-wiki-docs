Some Girls: My Life in a Harem, a book published in 2010 and written by Jillian Lauren, is an autobiographical account of her experiences as one of the paid young female "guests" of Prince Jefri Bolkiah, brother of the Sultan of Brunei, between 1992 and 1995.
The book focuses on Lauren's personal experiences, and includes a description of the arrangements she says were an established practice for young female guests of the prince during part of the 1990s.

Young, attractive women were hired for a short-term contract, typically for three weeks.
Contracts in some cases got extended, in some cases for up to a year or two or more.
