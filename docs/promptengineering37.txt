Prompt engineering is the process of structuring or crafting an instruction in order to produce better outputs from a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model.
A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform. A prompt for a text-to-text language model can be a query, a command, or a longer statement including context, instructions, and conversation history. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, choice of words and grammar, providing relevant context, or describing a character for the AI to mimic.
