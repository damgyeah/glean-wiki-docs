La Reina (also known as the Creole cattle) is a Nicaraguan local breed originating from the Bos taurus varieties brought to America during the Spanish colonization in the 15th century. In the 1950s Joaquin Reyna and her Friend Costantino Sacasa Carazo, both being Nicaraguan breeders, formed a herd with approximately 200 females with typical characteristics of Creole cattle from which the Reyna breed  was  created, their name originating from Joaquin Reyna himself. Selection of animals was focused on red coat colour (sorrel) and milk production. The Nicaraguan government started an official inventory in  the  1970s and in 1988 the Reyna cattle  were declared as national patrimony, and in conjunction with the National Agrarian University of Nicaragua (Universidad Nacional Agraria) (UNA) agreed to a genetic improvement program of the cattle.
