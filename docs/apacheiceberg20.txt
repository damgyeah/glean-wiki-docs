Apache Iceberg is a high performance open-source format for large analytic tables. Iceberg enables the use of SQL tables for big data while making it possible for engines like Spark, Trino, Flink, Presto, Hive, Impala, StarRocks, Doris, and Pig to safely work with the same tables, at the same time. Iceberg is released under the Apache License. Iceberg addresses the performance and usability challenges of Apache Hive tables in large and demanding data lake environments.
