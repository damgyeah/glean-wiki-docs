The Reliquary Shrine is an especially complex 14th century container for relics, now in The Cloisters, New York. It is made from translucent enamel, gilt-silver and paint, and dated to c 1325â€“50. Although first mentioned in a convent in Budapest, its style and influences indicates French craftsmanship. It has been tentatively attributed by the Met to Jean de Toul, a French goldsmith about whom little is known, but who is associated with a small number of works with similar stylistic characteristics.
